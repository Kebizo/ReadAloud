Hi…and welcome to the first episode of Shadow English Podcast.

In this podcast, I will talk about whatever is on my mind….which is not so unique in the world of podcasts. But what makes this podcast different…and hopefully useful, is that after you listen to me speak, you will have the opportunity to shadow me line-by-line. As you may already be able to tell, this podcast is meant for non-native speakers of English who wish to improve their listening, and most importantly, their speaking skills. The shadowing segment of each podcast will be at two speeds. One is slower than I normally talk, and the other is faster than I normally talk. I think practicing both speeds is important for pronunciation. And I think practicing at both speeds will also improve your listening skill.  
 
 
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the first episode of Shadow English. Please look forward to next time.
