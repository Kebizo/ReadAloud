Welcome to the Shadow English Podcast, where I say what is on my mind and you will have a chance to shadow what I say.

Hello again, welcome back. This is the second episode of Shadow English Podcast. I realize that I never really introduced myself in the first episode. My name is Kevin. You can tell how experienced I am in podcasting..haha..

Today, I wanted to talk about how I came up with the title of this podcast. It is actually a play on words in Japanese. Since I live in Japan, I thought my audience would be Japanese people who are studying English. But of course, I am open to listeners from anywhere in the world. 

You see, in Japanese, they don’t use the word ‘Shadow’, rather they say “Shadowing”. They use the “ing” form for the technique of repeating what someone says in order to improve one’s speaking skills. So, basically, I combined “Shadow” with “English” and then you get ‘Shadowing lish”. Haha, yeah, so it is kind of a play on words…meant for my Japanese listeners. Anyways, that is all for now. I will be posting weekly, by the way.. So tune in next week. Thanks for listening!
